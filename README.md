# 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
This is where I explore and practice Python through a variety of fun, useful, and educational mini-projects.

Whether you're here to browse, learn, or get inspired, feel free to look around.  
Each project reflects a step forward in my coding journey.

I highly recommend Mimo.org, it helped me learn programming in a fun and didactic way.

🚀 Happy coding!
